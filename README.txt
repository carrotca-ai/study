# 🧠 Python & ML Learning Log

This repository tracks my progress as I study Python and move toward becoming a Junior AI/ML Engineer in ~6 months.

## 📅 Goal

Become a Junior-level Machine Learning Engineer by building a solid foundation in:

- Python programming
- Data analysis with pandas & NumPy
- Machine learning basics (scikit-learn, models, metrics)
- Real-world mini projects
- Git & GitHub workflows

## 🗓️ Learning Plan (2025)

### Month 1 – Python Basics
- Variables, data types, conditions, loops
- Functions, lists, dictionaries, sets
- Working with files and strings
- Writing small scripts

### Month 2 – Data Handling
- `pandas`, `numpy`, data cleaning
- Working with CSV/JSON files
- Basic visualizations (matplotlib, seaborn)

### Month 3 – Intro to Machine Learning
- Supervised learning with `scikit-learn`
- Classification & regression
- Overfitting, train/test split

### Month 4–5 – Projects & Practice
- Real datasets (Titanic, Iris, etc.)
- Experimenting with models
- Building small pipelines

### Month 6 – Portfolio & GitHub
- Uploading projects
- Documenting code
- Getting ready for junior-level positions
